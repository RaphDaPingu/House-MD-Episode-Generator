**INT. PRINCETON-PLAINSBORO TEACHING HOSPITAL - DAY**

A 12-year-old boy, ADAM (autistic), is brought into the hospital by his parents. He is screaming and thrashing about.

DR. FOREMAN
What brings you in today?

ADAM'S MOTHER
He's been screaming for days. We don't know what's wrong with him.

DR. FOREMAN
Okay, Adam, let's see what we can do for you.

Foreman tries to examine Adam, but he is too upset to cooperate. Foreman orders some tests, but they all come back negative.

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

House and his team are discussing Adam's case.

HOUSE
So, we have a 12-year-old boy with autism who's been screaming for days. All the tests come back negative. What do you think?

FOREMAN
I don't know. Maybe it's just his autism.

CHASE
Yeah, but he's never had an episode like this before.

CAMERON
Maybe it's a sign of some underlying medical condition.

HOUSE
Or maybe it's just his autism.

Foreman and Cameron exchange a look.

HOUSE
(to Foreman)
What?

FOREMAN
It's just that you seem to be dismissive of autism.

HOUSE
I'm not dismissive of autism. I'm just saying that it's a possibility.

CAMERON
But it's also a possibility that there's something else going on.

HOUSE
Fine. We'll keep running tests. But I'm not going to waste my time chasing a ghost.

**INT. ADAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT**

House enters Adam's room. Adam is sitting on the bed, playing with a Rubik's cube.

HOUSE
Hey, Adam.

Adam doesn't look up.

HOUSE
(CONT'D)
I'm Dr. House. I'm here to help you.

Adam still doesn't look up.

HOUSE
(CONT'D)
I know you're probably scared. But I'm going to figure out what's wrong with you and make you better.

Adam finally looks up at House.

HOUSE
(CONT'D)
Do you want me to help you?

Adam nods.

HOUSE
(CONT'D)
Okay. Then let's get started.

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

House and his team are still discussing Adam's case.

HOUSE
So, we've run every test we can think of, and everything comes back negative.

FOREMAN
I'm starting to think that maybe it is just his autism.

CHASE
But why the sudden change in behavior?

CAMERON
I don't know. But I'm not giving up yet.

HOUSE
Fine. But we're running out of time. Adam's parents are getting impatient.

**INT. ADAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT**

House is sitting by Adam's bed. Adam is asleep.

House is looking at Adam's Rubik's cube. He picks it up and starts to play with it. He solves it in seconds.

House smiles.

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

House and his team are discussing Adam's case again.

HOUSE
I think I figured it out.

FOREMAN
Oh yeah? What is it?

HOUSE
Adam has savant syndrome.

CHASE
Savant syndrome?

CAMERON
It's a rare condition where people have exceptional abilities in one area, often at the expense of other areas.

HOUSE
In Adam's case, his savant ability is solving puzzles.

FOREMAN
But how does that explain his screaming?

HOUSE
I think the screaming is his way of coping with the stress of being in a new and unfamiliar environment.

CAMERON
So, what do we do now?

HOUSE
We get him out of here.

**INT. ADAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT**

House is packing Adam's bags.

HOUSE
Okay, Adam, it's time to go home.

Adam looks up at House.

HOUSE
(CONT'D)
You're going to be okay.

Adam smiles.

**EXT. PRINCETON-PLAINSBORO TEACHING HOSPITAL - DAY**

House is walking Adam and his parents out of the hospital.

ADAM'S MOTHER
Thank you, Dr. House.

HOUSE
You're welcome.
